INFR3120 Fall 2025 - Project Part 1

Team Members: Aarrav, Raj, Harrison



1. Project Overview

Our Campus Marketplace & Student Hub is a web-based platform designed specifically for individual university campuses to facilitate student-to-student commerce, service exchange, and community engagement. Similar to Facebook Marketplace but campus-exclusive, this platform allows students to buy and sell products, offer and request services like tutoring or study groups, and discover campus-wide events through an integrated calendar system.

The platform addresses the unique needs of campus communities by creating a trusted marketplace environment where students can safely transact with their peers. By combining marketplace functionality with a student hub that houses event calendars and service listings, we create a centralized digital space that strengthens campus community connections and makes student life more convenient.

For Part 1 of this project, we will focus on core marketplace and event management features with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Future development phases will include real-time chat features, user authentication systems, and enhanced community tools.
